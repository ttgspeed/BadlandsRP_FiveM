Dependencies :
- [Mythic Notify](https://github.com/mythicrp/mythic_notify)
- Mythic Base - NOT PUBLICLY RELEASED
- Mythic Inventory - NOT PUBLICLY RELEASED
- [Salty Tokenizer](https://github.com/SaltyGrandpa/salty_tokenizer) (This can be removed if wanted, it's just an extra layer of security)

>NOTE: As with most MythicRP releases at this point, this has several calls to Mythic Framework resources that have not (and may not) released publicly. This is intended as a **dev resource** at most and not a simple drag & drop to use on public servers. **Do not make any issues asking for it to be made to work on a public framework or why it isn't plug n' play.**

>Extra Note: This version is using individually placed Milo instances as the attempt to create instances and use a single interior was crap and resulted in having to address far too many downfalls of it. This would mean this only supports up to 32 clients as each map physically exists under the map.
